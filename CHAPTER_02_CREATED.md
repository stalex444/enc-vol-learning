**File**: `content/chapters/01-foundation/02.json`  
**Estimated Time**: 8 minutes

## 📚 Content Overview

### Phase 1: Prime

**Story**: Marco's Learning Moment
- Experienced volunteer (3 events)
- Sees Dr. Joe alone in hallway
- "Just one quick question..."
- Dr. Joe's gentle but firm boundary
- Team Lead's teaching moment
- "Real service sometimes means stepping back"

**Why This Matters**: Protecting the Frequency
- Dr. Joe holds space for 1,500 people
- Every interaction fragments his attention
- Not about ego—about energetics
- Surgeon analogy: preserving focus
- "Energetic surgery on collective consciousness"
- You serve by creating conditions for him to serve everyone

**Learning Objectives**:
1. Understand why strict boundaries exist
2. Know what is/isn't appropriate
3. Recognize how protection serves all participants
4. Feel confident redirecting inappropriate approaches

### Phase 2: Immerse

**3 Content Sections**:

1. **The Boundaries That Serve**
   - No photos (interrupts state, creates inequity)
   - No personal conversations (unless he initiates)
   - No relaying messages (proper channels exist)
   - No special access (you model restraint)
   - Pull quote: "When you understand your energy affects the field..."

2. **What Protection Looks Like**
   - Step between (gently, with presence)
   - Redirect to Customer Care
   - Stay warm but firm
   - Address volunteer boundary-crossing privately
   - Your presence creates permission

3. **The Greater Service**
   - Paradox: greatest gift is sometimes absence
   - Don't need personal attention to be transformed
   - Protecting space = enabling deeper teaching
   - Mastery = knowing when to create distance
   - This is what sacred service looks like

2. No photos/conversations/messages aren't arbitrary
3. You serve by ensuring he can serve everyone
