**Chapters with Aligned Takeaways:** 13 (after fix)

### Issue Found & Resolved:
**Module 01, Chapter 01** - Two keyPoints referenced Chapter 02 content:
- ❌ "Confidentiality protects the container and honors every participant's vulnerability"
- ❌ "Dr. Joe's boundaries exist to preserve his capacity to serve at the highest level"

**Fixed with Chapter 01 content:**
- ✅ "Your regulated nervous system becomes an organizing force for the field—when you're in coherence, others' nervous systems synchronize to yours"
- ✅ "The core agreement: participants do their inner work; volunteers hold the outer space"
- ✅ "Ground yourself first (three coherent breaths) before responding to someone in distress—respond from coherence, not panic"
- ✅ "Your preparation matters because you're training yourself to hold a frequency that serves everyone"
- ✅ "Service means holding the container steady so participants can surrender into vulnerability and do their deep work"
