**Estimated Time**: 10 minutes

## 📚 Content Overview

### Phase 1: Prime

**Story**: Maria's Two Moments
- First-time volunteer, Day 4 meditation
- Participant crying intensely → "I'm having a breakthrough"
- Different participant clutches chest → Medical called
- Team Lead: "Tears? That's the work. Chest pain? That's Medical."
- **Key insight**: "Her job wasn't to fix anyone. It was to know who to call."

**Why This Matters**: The Three Types of Support
- **Medical**: Licensed healthcare (RNs, Paramedics, MDs)
- **Emotional**: Licensed therapists (trauma-informed)
- **Meditation Assistance (MA)**: Trained by Dr. Joe personally
- Your role: Triage. Observe. Assess. Connect.
- "Is this body? Mind? Spirit? And who's trained to help?"

**Learning Objectives**:
1. Understand three types of professional support
2. Know which situations require which support
3. Develop confidence in assessment/triage
4. Learn preliminary signs for discernment

### Phase 2: Immerse

**5 Content Sections**:

1. **Medical Assistance: When the Body Needs Attention**
   - Chest pain, breathing difficulty, falls, injuries
   - Severe headaches, dizziness, nausea
   - Loss of consciousness, seizures
   - Team: RNs, Paramedics, MDs
   - **Key principle**: When in doubt about physical symptoms—call Medical. Always.
   - Pull quote: "The body is the unconscious mind..."

2. **Emotional/Psychological Support: When the Heart Needs Holding**
   - Intense distress beyond normal release
   - Panic attacks, dissociation
   - Traumatic memories surfacing
   - Self-harm thoughts, inability to self-regulate
   - Team: Licensed therapists (LPC, LMFT, LCSW)
   - **Key principle**: Notice when someone crosses from "feeling deeply" to "drowning"

3. **Meditation Assistance: When the Spirit Needs Guidance**
   - Meditation technique questions
   - Unusual energetic experiences
   - Energy movement (shaking, spontaneous movement)
   - Integration questions
   - Team: Long-term students trained by Dr. Joe
   - **Key principle**: "Is this normal in meditation?" = MA

4. **The Gray Areas: When It's Not Clear**
   - Panic attack: Both Medical + Emotional
   - Intense shaking: MA first, Medical if signs worsen
   - Crying that won't stop: 20+ minutes = Emotional Support
   - Trauma surfacing: Grounded = MA, Dissociating = Emotional
   - **Principle**: You don't have to be right. Just call someone.

5. **Your Sacred Discernment**
   - You have presence, intuition, ability to sense
   - Your nervous system knows the difference
   - Listen to: "Something's off" / "This feels different"
   - You see the baseline, notice the shift
   - **Gift**: You're awake, paying attention, caring

### Phase 3: Integrate

**4 Quiz Scenarios**:

1. **Intense Hand Shaking During Meditation**
   - Dramatic shaking, eyes closed, breathing normal
   - Tests: Energy release vs. seizure discernment
   - Correct: Observe, signal MA, watch for Medical signs
   - Teaches: Don't jump to worst-case, but do assess

2. **Grief Vision After Meditation**
   - Saw deceased mother, crying, unsure about continuing
   - Tests: MA vs. Emotional Support choice
   - Correct: Connect to MA (meditation experience)
   - Teaches: Grief in meditation context = MA first

3. **Dissociation or Deep Integration?**
   - 15 minutes post-meditation, staring, not moving
   - Tests: When to assess vs. when to wait
   - Correct: Gentle approach, get MA + Emotional if unresponsive
   - Teaches: Always assess, don't assume

4. **Chest Symptoms Self-Diagnosed as Anxiety**
   - "Heart racing, chest tight, but I think it's anxiety"
   - Tests: Never bypass Medical for cardiac symptoms
   - Correct: Walk to Medical immediately
   - Teaches: Chest symptoms = Medical, always, non-negotiable

### Phase 4: Anchor

**7 Key Takeaways**:
1. Three types: Medical (body), Emotional (mind), MA (spirit)
2. Medical for all physical symptoms—when in doubt, call
3. Emotional for distress beyond normal processing
4. MA for meditation-specific questions/experiences
5. Gray areas: call for help, professionals determine
6. Trust your instinct—nervous system knows
7. Your job: notice, assess, connect (not diagnose/treat)

**Integration**:
- Building discernment, not diagnosis
- Comes from presence, watching, caring
- Don't need to be perfect, just awake
- You're the bridge between participants and professionals

**Closing Quote**:
> "The best way to take care of the future is to take care of the present moment."

**Next**: How to Request Medical Assistance
