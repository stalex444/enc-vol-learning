    "story": "At a recent Advanced Week in Cancun, a first-time volunteer named Maria stood frozen in the hallway. A participant had just collapsed in tears after a profound meditation. Maria's training kicked in—but more than that, her presence did.\n\nShe didn't rush to fix. She didn't panic. She simply sat beside them, placed a gentle hand on their shoulder, and breathed. After a few minutes, the participant looked up with tears of gratitude: 'Thank you for just being here. For not making me wrong for feeling this.'\n\nThat's the essence of what we do. We hold space for transformation.",
    "whyThisMatters": "You are not here by accident. You've been called to serve in one of the most sacred roles imaginable—holding space for people as they literally rewire their brains and transform their lives. Dr. Joe often says, 'When you change your energy, you change your life. When you change your life, you change the world.' As crew, you are the guardians of that possibility. Your presence, your calm, your compassion—these create the field in which miracles happen.",

            "incorrect": "Remember: 'The moment you start feeling, you start healing.' Emotions aren't problems to be solved—they're energy in motion that needs to be felt and released. Your presence and calm create safety for that process. Taking them to a quiet space and simply being with them honors their experience without trying to fix it.",

When they surface during meditation, it's actually a sign of healing—the body is releasing what it's been holding. As crew, we create the safe container for that release. Your calm presence tells their nervous system: 'It's safe to feel this. You're not alone.'"
