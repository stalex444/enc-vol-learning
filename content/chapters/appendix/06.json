You know where to find quick reference when you need it.\n\nBut more than that—you understand that every protocol is a doorway to consciousness. That every interaction is an opportunity to serve transformation. That your presence matters as much as your precision.\n\n**This isn't the end of your learning. It's the beginning of your practice.**\n\nWhen you arrive at your first event, you'll have questions. You'll face situations not covered in any manual. You'll need to improvise with wisdom.\n\nThat's exactly right. That's the work.\n\nYour training gave you the foundation. Your service will give you mastery.\n\n🦋 **Welcome to the team. We're honored to serve alongside you.**"
