    "story": "Day 2, 4:45 AM. Most volunteers were still asleep. But not the Meditation Assists.\n\nSarah entered the ballroom in darkness. Meditation would begin at 6 AM. She'd be in position for the next three hours, watching 1,500 people drop into altered states. Ready to respond if someone needed help.\n\nShe'd trained for this. Read the protocol guide three times. Understood the difference between emotional release and crisis. Knew when to intervene and when to hold space. This was sacred responsibility.\n\nAcross the ballroom, the Room Reset team was already working. They'd been there since 10 PM the night before, after everyone left. Moving gravity chairs into position. Placing reserved signs. Setting up each section according to the detailed plan. Every chair in its place. Every sign correctly positioned.\n\nBy 5:30 AM, the Signs Lead was doing final checks. Walking each section, verifying placements, replacing damaged signs, ensuring clarity. The details that most people would never notice\u2014but would definitely notice if they were wrong.\n\nOutside, the Coherence Healing Ballroom Lead was coordinating with venue staff. Setting up the flow for tomorrow's CH session. Positioning materials. Planning entry patterns. Making sure 100+ HealEEs could enter smoothly, be cared for properly, and exit safely.\n\nSection Leads were already in position by 5:45 AM, scanning their areas. Everything ready? Any issues? Medical access clear? Participants would arrive in 15 minutes.\n\nThese weren't the visible roles. No one thanked the Room Reset team for working until midnight. Participants didn't know Meditation Assists were watching during every meditation. The Signs Lead's work was invisible if done correctly.\n\nBut without these roles? Chaos.\n\nWithout Room Reset, participants would arrive to find gravity chairs in wrong places, signs missing, sections disorganized.\n\nWithout Meditation Assists, medical emergencies would go unnoticed until too late.\n\nWithout Signs Lead, confusion would ripple through seating, creating constant disruptions.\n\nWithout CH Coordinators, Coherence Healing would be logistical disaster instead of sacred experience.\n\nAfter the event, Sarah reflected: 'I used to think the important roles were the ones people saw\u2014the Group Leads, the Door team, Customer Care. But now I understand: the most important roles are often the invisible ones. The ones that make everything else possible. The foundation no one notices\u2014until it's not there.'",

      "content": "Additional Duties are the roles that support everything else. They're assigned ON TOP OF your primary Week Long role.\n\n**Why these roles exist:**\n\nYour primary role (Group Greeter, HST member, etc.) is your consistent responsibility throughout the week. But certain functions need specialists:\n\n\u2022 **Meditation Assist (MA):** Requires specific training and temperament. Watching hundreds of people in altered states, knowing when and how to intervene.\n\n\u2022 **Room Reset:** Happens after everyone leaves (late night). Requires physical work, attention to detail, coordination.\n\n\u2022 **Signs Lead:** Ongoing management of all signage throughout event. Requires organization and proactive problem-solving.\n\n\u2022 **Coherence Healing coordination:** Complex logistics that need dedicated focus during CH sessions.\n\n\u2022 **Section Leads:** Additional layer of section oversight and coordination.\n\nThese roles are typically assigned to experienced volunteers who can handle both their primary duty AND the additional responsibility.\n\n**Why this chapter matters:**\n\nEven if you're not assigned these roles your first event, you need to understand them:\n\n1. **Coordination:** Your primary role will interact with these roles. Group Greeters work with Room Reset. HST coordinates with CH Outside Ballroom Lead. Understanding their function helps you coordinate better.\n\n2. **Appreciation:** When you understand what these roles do, you appreciate the invisible work. The person who stayed until midnight setting up chairs deserves recognition.\n\n3. **Aspiration:** These are often roles experienced volunteers grow into. Understanding them helps you see the path forward.\n\n4. **Coverage:** Sometimes these roles need help. If you understand their function, you can support them effectively.\n\nThis chapter goes deep into:\n\u2022 Meditation Assist complete protocol and scenarios\n\u2022 Room Reset coordination with Signs and Greeters\n\u2022 CH Lead coordination (ballroom and outside ballroom)\n\u2022 Section Lead responsibilities\n\u2022 How these roles interconnect with primary duties\n\nThese are the roles that make the invisible visible through their absence. When they're done well, no one notices. When they're done poorly, everything suffers.\n\nLearn them. Respect them. Aspire to them."

They may have had recent surgeries, spinal conditions, or mobility limitations. Losing track of chairs or placing them incorrectly means someone who needs accommodation doesn't get it.\n\n**Timing:**\nSetup typically happens 7 PM - 10 PM (or later). It's physical work. Requires attention to detail. Requires coordination across multiple sections.\n\n---\n\n**SIGNS LEAD:**\n\nManages all signage throughout the event\u2014reserved seats, section markers, group identifiers, etc.\n\n**PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITIES:**\n\n**Pre-event:**\n\u2022 Number and label reserved signs to match seating map\n\u2022 Write seat assignments on back of signs for quick organization\n\u2022 Identify missing or damaged signs\n\u2022 Implement workflow for sign replacements\n\u2022 Coordinate with Group Leads on sign needs\n\n**Daily management:**\n\u2022 Work with Room Reset Lead on evening placement\n\u2022 Ensure signs are in correct locations each morning\n\u2022 Replace damaged or missing signs quickly\n\u2022 Track sign inventory\n\u2022 Coordinate with Group Leads when signs go missing\n\u2022 Post updates about sign issues in Telegram\n\n**Why precision matters:**\nSigns indicate reserved seating for medical accommodations, accessibility needs, or specific participant requirements. Wrong sign = wrong person in wrong seat = accommodation fails.\n\n---\n\n**GREETER/ROOM:**\n\nGroup Greeter assigned to work with Room Reset Lead each evening for their color section's setup.\n\n**PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITIES:**\n\n**Evening setup (their section only):**\n\u2022 Ensure all gravity chairs for their color section are in position\n\u2022 Verify chairs are locked and stable\n\u2022 Place reserved signs correctly on assigned chairs\n\u2022 Check that each gravity chair has correct participant's name/sign\n\u2022 Report any missing chairs or signs to Room Reset Lead\n\u2022 Follow detailed instructions posted in Telegram by Room Reset Lead\n\n**Why this role matters:**\nRoom Reset Lead can't set up entire ballroom alone.

They need organized, compassionate coordination from outside the ballroom. This role ensures they're cared for before, during transition, and after CH.\n\n---\n\n**HOW BOTH CH LEADS WORK TOGETHER:**\n\n\u2022 Outside Lead manages HealEE gathering and entry\n\u2022 Communicates timing to Ballroom Lead: 'HealEEs ready to enter'\n\u2022 Ballroom Lead signals when ballroom is ready to receive them\n\u2022 Outside Lead coordinates entry flow\n\u2022 Ballroom Lead positions HealEEs in pods\n\u2022 Both coordinate with HSL, Medical, Door Lead, Group Leads\n\u2022 After CH: Ballroom Lead manages in-ballroom breakdown\n\u2022 Outside Lead manages exit flow and caregiver reunion\n\n**The principle:**\nCH has too many moving parts for one person.

They're assigned in addition to it, typically because:\n1. You have capacity and experience to handle both\n2. The timing doesn't conflict (Room Reset is evening, primary role is daytime)\n3. Your primary role complements the additional duty (Greeter who knows section does Room Reset for that section)\n\n**Managing dual responsibilities:**\n\u2022 Communicate clearly about your availability\n\u2022 Don't overcommit\u2014if dual roles are too much, speak up\n\u2022 Prioritize based on timing (if both roles need you simultaneously, escalate to Team Lead)\n\u2022 Take care of yourself\u2014additional duties are demanding\n\u2022 Ask for support when needed\n\n**Recognition:**\nVolunteers who take on Additional Duties are providing extra service. This should be recognized and appreciated. If you see someone doing Room Reset at 10 PM after being in the ballroom since 5 AM\u2014thank them. Their invisible work makes everything possible."
