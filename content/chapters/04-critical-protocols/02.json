    "story": "Day 1, registration. Marcus was helping participants find their seats when a woman approached him.\n\n'I need a gravity chair,' she said. 'I have back problems and I can't sit in a regular chair for hours.'\n\nMarcus had been briefed on the protocol. 'I understand. Gravity chairs are assigned based on medical need through our Medical team. Let me direct you to the Customer Service table where they can help you submit a request.'\n\n'But I need one,' she insisted. 'I drove eight hours to be here. I have a doctor's note.'\n\n'I hear you,' Marcus said calmly. 'And the Medical team will absolutely review your need. The Customer Service table is right over there\u2014they'll get you the right form and connect you with Medical. They make the decisions about gravity chair assignments based on medical necessity.'\n\nThe woman went to Customer Service. Later, Marcus saw her\u2014in a regular seat, not a gravity chair. She looked frustrated.\n\nDuring lunch break, his Team Lead explained: 'There are 30 gravity chairs. We had 80 requests. Medical prioritized based on severity: recent surgeries, severe spinal conditions, specific disabilities. Her back pain was real, but others had more acute needs. It's hard, but it's fair.'\n\nDay 3, the same woman approached Marcus during break. 'I wanted to apologize for being pushy on Day 1. I understand now why I didn't get a chair. And honestly? I'm doing okay in the regular seat. I've been adjusting my posture and it's manageable.'\n\nMarcus smiled. 'I'm glad you're finding a way. And if it becomes unmanageable, Medical can always reassess.'\n\nShe nodded. 'I get it now. The people in those chairs really need them. It was never about me not mattering\u2014it was about them needing it more.'\n\nMarcus understood then: the protocol isn't about saying no. It's about ensuring limited resources go to the people who need them most. That's not cruelty. That's stewardship.",

        "content": "**This is where volunteers encounter the most difficulty. People want chairs. You can't give them. How do you handle this?**\n\n**THE SCRIPTS:**\n\n**Scenario 1: Someone asks you for a gravity chair**\n\n\u274c Wrong: 'Sorry, we're all out.' (Implies first-come-first-served)\n\u274c Wrong: 'You don't look like you need one.' (You're not Medical)\n\u274c Wrong: 'Let me see what I can do.' (You can't do anything)\n\n\u2705 Right: 'Gravity chairs are assigned based on medical need through our Medical team. If you have a medical condition that requires accommodation, please visit the Customer Service table and they'll help you submit a request. Medical evaluates all requests and assigns chairs based on severity of need.'\n\n**Scenario 2: Someone argues they NEED one**\n\n'I have a bad back. I can't sit in a regular chair all day. I need a gravity chair.'\n\n\u2705 Response: 'I understand you're dealing with back pain. The process for gravity chair assignment goes through Customer Service and Medical. They can evaluate your specific situation and determine what accommodation is appropriate. Let me point you to their table.'\n\n**If they push back:**\n\n'But I really NEED one. This isn't optional for me.'\n\n\u2705 Response: 'I hear that this is important for you. And that's exactly why there's a process\u2014Medical needs to evaluate everyone's needs to ensure the limited chairs go to those with the most acute medical necessity. Customer Service can help you start that process.'\n\n**Scenario 3: Someone says they were denied and it's unfair**\n\n'I requested a chair and they said no. But I have a doctor's note. This is discrimination.'\n\n\u2705 Response: 'I'm sorry you were disappointed by that decision. Gravity chair assignments are made by our Medical team based on medical necessity. If you'd like to appeal that decision or discuss it further, please speak directly with the Medical team at the Customer Service table. They can explain their decision criteria and potentially reassess.'\n\n**What NOT to say:**\n\u2022 'Yeah, it does seem unfair' (undermines protocol)\n\u2022 'I don't make the rules' (dismissive)\n\u2022 'There's nothing I can do' (true, but not helpful alone)\n\u2022 'Other people need it more than you' (judgmental)\n\n**What TO convey:**\n\u2022 The process exists and is fair\n\u2022 Medical makes decisions, not volunteers\n\u2022 There's a path to appeal (Customer Service/Medical)\n\u2022 You understand their frustration\n\u2022 You're not the enemy\u2014you're explaining the system\n\n**Scenario 4: Someone with a chair asks if their friend can use it during breaks**\n\n'I'm assigned to this chair, but I'm going to lunch. Can my friend sit here while I'm gone? She also has back problems.'\n\n\u2705 Response: 'Chairs are assigned to specific individuals based on medical assessment. When you're at lunch, the chair should remain available for you when you return. If your friend needs medical accommodation, she should speak with Customer Service about the assignment process.'\n\n**Why:** Chairs aren't community property. Letting others use them creates confusion about assignments and potentially denies the assigned person their accommodation when they return.\n\n**Scenario 5: Someone says they'll just stand/leave if they can't have a chair**\n\n'Fine. If I can't have a gravity chair, I'm just going to stand in the back/leave the event. This is ridiculous.'\n\n\u2705 Response: 'I understand you're frustrated. If you're having difficulty participating comfortably, I'd encourage you to speak with Medical. They may have other accommodations or solutions beyond gravity chairs. The event wants everyone to be able to participate fully.'\n\n**Your tone throughout:** Calm, compassionate, firm, consistent.\n\nYou're not the bad guy. You're the messenger of a fair system."

Can I help you find your assigned seat?'\n\nIf they say it's theirs: 'Great! What's your name?'

Chairs being moved or adjusted unsafely**\n\n**What it looks like:**\n\u2022 Chairs dragged into aisles\n\u2022 Chairs repositioned blocking exits\n\u2022 Chairs angled creating safety hazards\n\n**Why it matters:**\n\u2022 Fire code violations\n\u2022 Trip hazards\n\u2022 Emergency egress blocked\n\n**What you do:**\nReposition immediately. 'I need to adjust this chair's position for safety. Let me help you get comfortable while keeping the aisle clear.'\n\n**3. Chairs being shared/swapped**\n\n**What it looks like:**\n\u2022 Two people taking turns in one assigned chair\n\u2022 People trading chairs mid-event\n\u2022 Someone giving their chair to a friend\n\n**Why it matters:**\n\u2022 Medical assessed each person for specific chair assignment\n\u2022 Swapping defeats the purpose of assessment\n\u2022 Creates confusion about who's supposed to be where\n\n**What you do:**\n'I notice you're trading chairs. Assignments are specific to individuals based on medical need. If either of you needs reassessment for a different chair or accommodation, Customer Service can help with that.'\n\n**4. Assigned person not using their chair**\n\n**What it looks like:**\n\u2022 Chair remains empty most of the event\n\u2022 Person chooses to sit elsewhere\n\u2022 Person no longer needs accommodation\n\n**Why it matters:**\n\u2022 Wasted resource that could go to someone else\n\u2022 Impacts future assignment decisions\n\n**What you do:**\nIf you notice a pattern (chair empty for hours), mention to Team Lead. They can coordinate with Customer Service/Medical to potentially reassign.\n\nDon't confront the person\u2014maybe they're in bathroom, taking break, or have valid reason. Team Lead handles this assessment.\n\n**5. Conflicts between gravity chair users and regular seat holders**\n\n**What it looks like:**\n\u2022 Complaints that gravity chairs take up too much space\n\u2022 Regular seat holders saying chairs block their view\n\u2022 Tension over perceived 'special treatment'\n\n**Why it matters:**\n\u2022 Creates negative energy in the space\n\u2022 Makes gravity chair users feel uncomfortable\n\u2022 Undermines inclusive environment\n\n**What you do:**\nIf someone complains: 'Gravity chairs are medical accommodations for participants who need them to fully participate. Just like wheelchair ramps, they ensure everyone can access the event. The placement has been designed to minimize impact while providing necessary access.'\n\nStay neutral, don't take sides, redirect to Team Lead if conflict escalates.\n\n**Your overall approach:**\n\u2022 Observe regularly but don't hover\n\u2022 Address issues promptly but kindly\n\u2022 Assume positive intent first\n\u2022 Escalate to Team Lead if conflicts arise\n\u2022 Maintain dignity for all participants"
