    "story": "Day 4, afternoon meditation. Rachel was monitoring the Blue section when she saw it.\n\nRow 12, seat 7. A man\u2014mid-40s\u2014suddenly went rigid. His whole body stiffened. Then jerking. Rhythmic, involuntary movements. His eyes rolled back.\n\nRachel's training kicked in immediately.\n\nSeizure.\n\nShe moved quickly to him. Checked: breathing? Yes. Space around him? Clear. Nothing sharp nearby? No.\n\nShe signaled another volunteer: 'Get Medical. NOW.'\n\nShe knelt beside him. Didn't touch him. Didn't try to hold him down. Didn't put anything in his mouth. Just watched. Timed it. Protected his space.\n\n45 seconds. The jerking slowed. Stopped. His body relaxed.\n\nMedical arrived within 90 seconds of her signal. Two RNs, equipment ready.\n\nRachel briefed them quickly: 'Tonic-clonic seizure. Lasted about 45 seconds. Stopped on its own. He's breathing. Post-ictal now.'\n\nThe lead RN looked at her. 'You did everything right. Perfect response. Timing the seizure, protecting his space, not intervening incorrectly, getting us here fast. This is textbook.'\n\nThe man came to slowly. Confused. Disoriented. Medical assessed him, checked vitals, took history. Turned out: known epilepsy. Forgot his medication that morning.\n\nMedical monitored him for 30 minutes. He was fine. Chose to continue the event with increased medication compliance.\n\nAfter the event, Rachel's Team Lead pulled her aside.\n\n'You handled that seizure like a pro. Do you know why it mattered that you did it right?'\n\n'Because I didn't make it worse?'\n\n'Exactly. People panic. They try to hold the person down, put things in their mouth, move them during the seizure. That causes injury. You did none of that. You protected him by knowing what NOT to do. That's the difference between a good volunteer and a great one.'\n\nRachel understood: knowing the protocol isn't just about helping. It's about not harming.",

      "content": "Seizures happen at these events. Not often, but they happen.\n\nWhy?\n\n1. **Pre-existing conditions:** People with epilepsy attend. Sometimes they forget medications. Sometimes stress or lack of sleep lowers their threshold.\n\n2. **Intense meditation states:** Deep breathing, altered states, hyperventilation\u2014these can occasionally trigger seizure activity in susceptible individuals.\n\n3. **Dehydration and exhaustion:** Long days, inadequate water, low blood sugar\u2014these are seizure triggers.\n\n4. **Unknown conditions:** Some people have their first seizure at an event. No prior history. This is rare but possible.\n\nYou will likely witness a seizure if you volunteer enough times. When you do, your response matters.\n\n**Good response:**\n- Prevents injury\n- Gets appropriate medical help\n- Provides accurate information to Medical\n- Stays calm, models calm for others\n- Allows seizure to run its course safely\n\n**Poor response:**\n- Causes injury (restraining, inserting objects in mouth)\n- Delays medical help (panic, confusion, unclear communication)\n- Provides inaccurate information (guessing vs. observing)\n- Creates chaos (yelling, panicking, drawing crowd)\n- Interferes with the body's process\n\nThis chapter teaches you:\n\u2022 How to recognize different types of seizures\n\u2022 The exact protocol for responding to tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizures\n\u2022 What NEVER to do (dangerous myths)\n\u2022 When to call 911 vs. when Medical handles it\n\u2022 Post-seizure care and monitoring\n\u2022 How to document and communicate what you witnessed\n\nThis is life-saving information.

        "content": "**When you recognize a tonic-clonic seizure, follow this protocol EXACTLY:**\n\n**STEP 1: STAY CALM AND ASSESS (5 seconds)**\n\u2022 Confirm it's a seizure (loss of consciousness, rhythmic jerking)\n\u2022 Note the time it started (check watch/phone)\n\u2022 Quick safety scan: Are they about to fall off something? Hit something sharp?\n\n**STEP 2: PROTECT FROM INJURY (Immediate)**\n\u2022 If they're falling, try to ease them to the ground if possible\n\u2022 If already on ground, ensure space around them\n\u2022 Move furniture, equipment, or other objects that could cause injury\n\u2022 Do NOT try to hold them down or stop the movements\n\u2022 Do NOT put anything in their mouth\n\u2022 Do NOT try to move them unless they're in immediate danger (fire, stairs, etc.)\n\n**STEP 3: GET HELP (Immediate\u2014while protecting them)**\n\u2022 Signal another volunteer or staff member\n\u2022 Say clearly: 'Medical emergency\u2014seizure. Get Medical NOW.'\n\u2022 If you have phone, post in Telegram:\n  '\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8 MEDICAL EMERGENCY\n  \u2022 [Name if known]\n  \u2022 SEIZURE IN PROGRESS\n  \u2022 Location: [precise location]\n  \u2022 Started at [time]\n  \u2022 I am with them'\n\u2022 Do NOT leave them alone to find help\u2014send someone else\n\n**STEP 4: MONITOR AND TIME (During seizure)**\n\u2022 Stay with them, position yourself nearby\n\u2022 Keep timing\u2014note how long the seizure lasts\n\u2022 Observe their breathing (may be irregular\u2014this is normal during seizure)\n\u2022 Watch for injury (hitting head, biting tongue, etc.)\n\u2022 Keep others back\u2014protect their dignity and give Medical space when they arrive\n\u2022 Do NOT restrain them or put pressure on their limbs\n\n**STEP 5: POSITION FOR SAFETY (When jerking stops)**\n\u2022 Once jerking completely stops and body relaxes, check breathing\n\u2022 If breathing normally and no neck/spinal injury suspected: Turn them on their side (recovery position)\n  - This prevents choking if they vomit\n  - Keeps airway clear\n  - Tilt head slightly back to open airway\n\u2022 If NOT breathing or breathing very poorly: DO NOT MOVE\u2014Medical will handle airway\n\u2022 If neck/spinal injury suspected (fell from height, hit head hard): DO NOT MOVE\u2014Medical will handle\n\n**STEP 6: PROVIDE POST-ICTAL CARE (After seizure, before Medical arrives)**\n\u2022 Talk to them calmly: 'You're safe. You had a seizure. Help is coming.'\n\u2022 Don't expect them to respond coherently yet\n\u2022 Keep them on their side\n\u2022 Loosen any tight clothing around neck\n\u2022 Stay with them, provide calm presence\n\u2022 Don't give them food, water, or medication\n\u2022 Don't let them walk around (they're disoriented, may fall)\n\n**STEP 7: BRIEF MEDICAL (When they arrive)**\n\u2022 How long the seizure lasted (total time from start to stop of jerking)\n\u2022 Description of what you saw\n\u2022 Any injuries (hit head, bit tongue, etc.)\n\u2022 Are they breathing normally now\n\u2022 Level of consciousness post-seizure\n\u2022 Any information about them (name, known epilepsy, etc.)\n\n**CRITICAL TIMING THRESHOLDS:**\n\u2022 Seizure lasting MORE than 5 minutes \u2192 Call 911 immediately (Status epilepticus\u2014life threatening)\n\u2022 Second seizure before they fully recover from first \u2192 Call 911 immediately\n\u2022 Not breathing normally after seizure stops \u2192 Call 911 immediately\n\u2022 Injured in the fall (head trauma, broken bones) \u2192 Medical assesses, may call 911",

NEVER do these:**\n\n**\u274c NEVER put anything in their mouth**\n\n*The myth:* They'll swallow their tongue.\n*The truth:* It's physically impossible to swallow your tongue.\n*The danger:* Objects in the mouth can:\n  - Break teeth\n  - Cause choking\n  - Obstruct airway\n  - Injure your fingers if they bite down\n  - Block Medical's airway management\n\nAbsolutely nothing goes in their mouth during or immediately after a seizure. Nothing.\n\n**\u274c NEVER try to hold them down or restrain their movements**\n\n*The myth:* You need to stop the jerking.\n*The truth:* The seizure must run its course. You can't stop it.\n*The danger:* Restraining can:\n  - Cause muscle, ligament, or bone injuries\n  - Increase their distress\n  - Injure you if they're strong\n  - Doesn't stop the seizure, just adds harm\n\nLet the body move. Protect from injury, but don't restrain.\n\n**\u274c NEVER give them water, food, or medication during or immediately after**\n\n*The myth:* They need water or their medication.\n*The truth:* They can't swallow safely while seizing or immediately post-ictal.\n*The danger:* They can:\n  - Choke\n  - Aspirate liquid into lungs (pneumonia)\n  - Worsen medical condition\n\nWait until they're fully alert and Medical clears them to drink/eat.\n\n**\u274c NEVER move them unless they're in immediate danger**\n\n*The myth:* They need to be more comfortable.\n*The truth:* Movement can cause injury if they have fractures or head trauma.\n*The danger:* Moving can:\n  - Worsen spinal injuries\n  - Cause additional trauma\n  - Complicate medical assessment\n\nOnly move if they're in immediate danger (fire, about to fall off something, in water). Otherwise, let them be where they are.\n\n**\u274c NEVER leave them alone**\n\n*The myth:* They need privacy.\n*The truth:* They need monitoring in case complications arise.\n*The danger:* They could:\n  - Have another seizure\n  - Stop breathing\n  - Aspirate vomit\n  - Be confused and wander into danger\n  - Need immediate intervention\n\nStay with them until Medical arrives and takes over.\n\n**\u274c NEVER assume they're okay immediately after**\n\n*The myth:* Seizure's over, they're fine now.\n*The truth:* Post-ictal state can last 30+ minutes. They need medical evaluation.\n*The danger:* Complications can include:\n  - Another seizure\n  - Head injury from fall\n  - Cardiac issues\n  - Underlying cause needs assessment\n\nAlways get Medical involved. Every seizure gets evaluated.\n\n**The principle: First, do no harm.**\n\nYour job during a seizure:\n1. Protect them from injury\n2. Time it\n3. Get Medical\n4. Monitor\n5. Stay calm\n\nThat's it.
